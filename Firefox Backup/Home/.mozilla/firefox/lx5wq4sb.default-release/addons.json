The Facebook Container extension for Firefox helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Facebook.","fullDescription":"What does it do?\nFacebook Container works by isolating your Facebook identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Facebook to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension closes your Facebook tabs, deletes your Facebook cookies, and logs you out of Facebook.\nThe next time you navigate to Facebook it will load in a new blue colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Facebook only in the Container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Facebook Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWhat data does Mozilla receive from this extension?\nMozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn more\n\nOther Containers\nFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more about Containers on our support site.\n\nKnown Issues\nWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search, or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.\n\nNOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nWhat version of Firefox do I need for this?\nThis extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on Desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.\n\nIf you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)\n\nHow does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nReport Issues\nIf you come across any issues with this extension, please let us know by filing an issue here.

Cookies are separated by container, allowing you to use the web with multiple identities or accounts simultaneously.","fullDescription":"About This Extension\n\nThe Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension lets you carve out a separate box for each of your online lives – no more opening a different browser just to check your work email! Here is a quick video showing you how it works.\n\nUnder the hood, it separates website storage into tab-specific Containers. Cookies downloaded by one Container are not available to other Containers. With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...\n\n    Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.\n    Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)\n    Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)\n\n\nAfter installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers. Change their colors, names, and icons. Long-click the new tab button to open a new Container tab.\n\nPrivacy in Firefox Multi-Account Containers\n\nThe Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension does not send any information to Mozilla.\n\nHow does this compare to the Facebook Container extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. The Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container. This extension can be customized to suit your needs for multiple sites and multiple logins, but takes more time to set up than Facebook Container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nCan I use both Multi-Account Containers and Facebook Container?\nYes, but you need to be a little careful. Don't use Multi-Account Container to assign facebook.com to a Container, and then try installing Facebook Container. If you a Multi-Account Containers user and want to use both addons, unassign facebook.com, messenger.com, and instagram.com first, then install Facebook Container.\n\nHaven't I seen this in Firefox before?\n\nFirefox Multi-Account Containers was first introduced as \"Containers\" available only in Firefox Nightly. It went on to be a Test Pilot Experiment, where we improved the user experience and added new features. Now it exists here as an extension that can be installed by all Firefox users.\n\nAlthough you can still use the feature built into Firefox Nightly, we recommend using this extension as it has a richer user experience.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\n\nCtrl + . (period) keyboard shortcut is available to open the containers panel. You can then use tab and the enter keys to open new container tabs.","weeklyDownloads":8935,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/4757633/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/196/196940.png?modified=1543520769","width":700,"height":386,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/196/196940.png?modified=1543520769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":353,"caption":"Containers let you separate the different parts of your online life."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/196/196941.png?modified=1543520771","width":700,"height":386,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/196/196941.png?modified=1543520771","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":353,"caption":"Select from categories like Shopping, Finance, and Work or create custom labels that work for you."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/196/196942.png?modified=1543520772","width":700,"height":386,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/196/196942.png?modified=1543520772","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":353,"caption":"Use color-coded labels to see different Containers at a glance."}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.5643,"reviewCount":2073,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/reviews/","updateDate":1548362109000},{"id":"{6AC85730-7D0F-4de0-B3FA-21142DD85326}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/271-32.png?modified=1488993385","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/271-64.png?modified=1488993385","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/271-128.png?modified=1488993385"},"name":"ColorZilla","version":"3.3","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/595546/colorzilla-3.3-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"http://www.colorzilla.com/","supportURL":"http://www.colorzilla.com/","description":"Advanced Eyedropper, Color Picker, Gradient Generator and other colorful goodies...","fullDescription":"With ColorZilla you can get a color reading from any point in your browser, quickly adjust this color and paste it into another program.

Enable Automatic Mode!\nThe Automatic Mode will overwrite your standard ways of opening new tabs - even when opened from an external program. Instead of opening tabs in No Container, it will open them in a freshly created Temporary Container. No more cookie, cache and storage collecting in one place, everything happens in its own isolated Temporary Container. If you enable Automatic Mode, you should also configure Mouse Clicks to open new Temporary Containers. Recommended preferences:\n\nIsolation > Global > Mouse Clicks:\n\n    Middle Mouse: Always\n\n\n\nHow to stay logged in on some websites in Automatic Mode?\nYou can use the official Multi-Account Containers Add-on from Mozilla to keep data (like cookies) from some websites in permanent containers and with that stay logged in. Then you can easily leave \"Automatic Mode\" enabled, which is preferable from a privacy-perspective.

Also - when the last tab in an automatically created Temporary Container closes it gets deleted (after 15minutes by default, so you can Undo Close Tabs in that timeframe) - and with it all data that websites created inside that Container. As a bonus it'll strip referer information if you use configured Websites, Isolation or Mouse Clicks to open new Temporary Containers. Besides enhancing privacy containers also do something for security. They help preventing CSRF, clickjacking, or other attacks which rely on the presence of ambient credentials. For more details and comparisons with other privacy enhancing methods check the bottom of this description.\n\n\nOpen Tabs in new Temporary Containers\n\n    Automatically in \"Automatic Mode\"\n    Isolation:\n    > Configuring per Domain\n    > MiddleMouse Click on a Link*\n    > Ctrl/Cmd+LeftMouse Click on a Link*\n    > LeftMouse Click on a Link*\n    > Configuring based on Navigation Target*\n    Clicking the \"Temporary Containers\"-Icon\n    Clicking on \"Open Link in New Temporary Container Tab\" in the ContextMenu of a Link\n    Pressing the Alt+C Shortcut\n\n    * Configurable in the Preferences Globally and Per Domain (disabled by default)\n\nNotes: Isolation wont work on or to addons.mozilla.org. Firefox prevents content scripts on and canceling requests to that domain.\n\nOther Keyboard Shortcuts\nOpen Tabs in the currently active Container by\n\n    Pressing Alt+X*\n    It's also possible to Middle Mouse or Ctrl/Cmd+Left Click on the default new tab icon\n\n\nOpen Tabs in new \"No Container\" Tabs (might be useful in Automatic Mode)\n\n    Pressing Alt+N* (Tab) or Shift+Alt+C* (Window)\n    It's also possible to RightClick ContextMenu on a Link \"Open Link in New Container Tab\" > \"No Container\"\n\n\n* Disabled by default. Need to be activated in the Advanced Add-on options.\n\n\nAutomatically Delete History\nThere's a feature that lets you open special Temporary Containers that automatically delete their History. It needs to be explicitly enabled in the options under \"Advanced\". It comes with a warning since Firefox doesn't support that feature fully yet: Every Full Website URL that you visit (including path) will get completely removed from history, since it's not possible to get only the History for one Container yet. Make sure to read the warning and explanation carefully before using that feature.\n\n\nSet Cookies\nSometimes you might want to set and send a specific cookie even when browsing in a Temporary Container. The advanced Set Cookies feature lets you configure on which websites cookies should be set. Setting cookies can make you easier fingerprintable. Especially when they contain user/session-specific data. Avoid setting cookies if you can.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy and Permissions\nTemporary Containers NEVER sends any data to external servers and it does not track anything. It only stores necessary data LOCALLY to provide functionality.\n\nTemporary Containers asks for permissions upon installation:\n\n    \"Access your data for all websites\": Required to provide automatic reopening of websites in Temporary Containers. In order to do that, it is necessary to be able to intercept and potentially cancel every request inside the browser. This is the all_urls permission in combination with the webRequest and webRequestBlocking permissions.\n    \"Access browser tabs\": Required to access the tabs URL, which is also needed to provide automatic reopening of Websites in Temporary Containers in cases where the currently loaded URL in the tab is relevant to decide whether to stay in a container or open a new one. This is the tabs permission.\n    \"Monitor extension usage and manage themes\": Required to provide automatic interoperability with other Container Add-ons like Multi-Account Containers, Facebook Container and Containerise. This is the management permission.\n\nMore required permissions included in the Add-on that don't show up as special text when installing the Add-on are:\n\n    contextMenus: Required to add the context menu entry when right clicking links.\n    contextualIdentities: Required to use the container feature itself, which is natively available in Firefox with this permission.\n    cookies: Required to manage tabs based on the \"cookieStoreId\", which is the internal way of handling tabs in combination with the container feature.\n    storage: Required to store and read preferences/options and data needed to provide functionality.\n\n\nYou can find tips for assessing the safety of an extension here and more general explanation about permission requests here.\n\n\nFree Software / Open Source\nTemporary Containers is Free Software / OpenSource published under the MIT License - so you could check the source or contribute on GitHub, if you'd like. If you want an easy way of taking a look into the source that actually is installed when clicking the \"Add to Firefox\" button, you can use the excellent Extension source viewer Add-on.\n\n\nSupport and Feedback\nIf you have any Suggestions, Feedback or Bugs please make sure to file an Issue on GitHub.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nIf \"Firefox will: Never remember history\" in the Firefox Preferences/Options under \"Privacy & Security > History\" is selected or you're in a Private Window, then Temporary Containers will not work, since Containers aren't available in Private Windows. Also make sure that you can see a grayed out but ticked Checkbox with the description \"Enable Container Tabs\" in the Firefox Preferences/Options under \"Tabs\" after installing. You might need to reinstall Temporary Containers or refresh your Firefox profile if you can't see the ticked Checkbox there.\n\n\nCompatibility with other Add-ons\n\n    Foxy Gestures User Scripts to open new Temporary Containers\n\n\n\nComplementing Add-ons\n\n    I don't care about cookies: If you browse in Automatic Mode and are tired of seeing Cookie and Privacy reminders all over the place, this Add-on is for you. It removes almost all of them!\n    Switch Container Plus: Allows to switch the current tab to a different container using a toolbar icon popup.*\n\n    * There are security concerns involved when changing a tab between containers. Before installing, please read this article on the matter.\n\n\nRecommended privacy enhancing Add-ons\n\n    Decentraleyes:  Protects you against tracking through “free”, centralized, content delivery by automatically injecting local resources if possible.\n    Don’t track me google : If your search-engine of choice happens to be Google this Add-on will remove the tracking automatically placed on result-links. Or just use startpage.com instead.\n    HTTPS Everywhere:  Automatically redirects you to the secure version of websites if available.\n    Request Control: Lets you filter session, ref, utm and more query parameters from URLs and can also circumvent outgoing trackers on websites\n    Skip Redirect: Automatically skip redirects if possible\n    uBlock Origin:  I guess you already know this one. If not, check it out.\n\n\nYou might also want to check out github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js, which has comprehensive informations regarding Firefox configurations and a list of Add-ons.\n\nComparison with other privacy configurations and Add-ons\n\n    Private Windows: If you open “Private Windows” in Firefox, all tabs that you open within Private Windows (even multiple ones) use the same underlying container and accept first-party and third-party cookies. So if you do your browsing within Private Windows, it can easily be tracked between sites while the windows are open. A way to test that is, just login to a site in one Private Window, open another tab in a new Private Window and open the same site again — you’ll see that you’re still logged in. Of course, if you then close the windows, the container storage is cleared.\n    Disabled third-party cookies, maybe even with First Party Isolation: All first-party data will remain on your disk. If you for example open a link to an item on a shopping site in one tab and a little bit later open a link to another item on the same shopping site in another tab — then it’s clear to the site that you saw both items because of cookies/storage. If you're interested in a deep-dive into comparison with FPI or even want to participate in the discussion, then you can here.\n    Cookies AutoDelete to automatically remove cookies and localStorage: The same as with \"Private Windows\" and “Disabled third-party cookies” applies as long as the cookie storage isn’t cleared — which depends on which settings you have in CAD and defaults to manually clicking \"Clean\". Also with localStorage support enabled you make fingerprinting easier, because CAD needs to set a cookie for the domains you visit and CAD can’t clear indexebDB storage or CacheStorage at all (because of Firefox API limitations). If you want to see it yourself try filling your indexedDB and localStorage with 5kb on this site. Now close the tab (and click Clean depending on your settings), open the site again and you’ll see that the indexedDB storage is still there. It’s still pretty useful to use Cookies AutoDelete: it can keep your permanent container clean from unwanted Cookies. Make sure to activate the Container Support — and instead of activating localStorage support I’d recommend using Temporary Containers.\n    Different profiles or even Virtual Machines: The same as with \"Private Windows\" and “Disabled third-party cookies” applies. However, different profiles / VMs of course greatly increase security because storage-wise everything is totally separated and thus also stronger isolated. But that doesn't apply to per Tab or per Domain basis.\n\n\nSo, whether you use First-Party Isolation, Cookie Cleaners, different Profiles or VMs - Containers can give you an easy to handle layer of isolation, privacy and security on top. That being said, please keep in mind that none of that makes you untrackable, because of Browser fingerprinting.","weeklyDownloads":1079,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"stoically","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13470938/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/222/222022.png?modified=1562747796","width":282,"height":122,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/222/222022.png?modified=1562747796","thumbnailWidth":282,"thumbnailHeight":122},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/222/222021.png?modified=1562747797","width":792,"height":785,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/222/222021.png?modified=1562747797","thumbnailWidth":484,"thumbnailHeight":480},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/222/222020.png?modified=1562747797","width":729,"height":574,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/222/222020.png?modified=1562747797","thumbnailWidth":610,"thumbnailHeight":480},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/222/222019.png?modified=1562747797","width":746,"height":617,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/222/222019.png?modified=1562747797","thumbnailWidth":580,"thumbnailHeight":480},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200204.png?modified=1562747792","width":496,"height":475,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200204.png?modified=1562747792","thumbnailWidth":496,"thumbnailHeight":475},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/222/222018.png?modified=1562747797","width":976,"height":485,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/222/222018.png?modified=1562747797","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":318}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6842,"reviewCount":60,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/reviews/","updateDate":1567001411000},{"id":"{99c277af-d778-4a0b-9faa-b1d8165f0a55}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-32.png","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-64.png","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-128.png"},"name":"Dark Theme","version":"4.2","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/2985849/dark_theme-4.2-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"description":"Perfect dark them for you Firefox powered by new Web Extension API.\nAll colors mode.","fullDescription":"This theme sets all possible color parameters.
